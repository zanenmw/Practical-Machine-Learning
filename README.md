# Practical-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the documentation and R code of the final course project of the online e-learning [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) on Coursera.

The task was to predict the type of activity based on data from several accelerometers.

The file [`Activity.md`](https://github.com/zanenmw/Practical-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Activity.md) contains a description of the task and the machine-learning process together with the results.

The corresponding R commands can be found in the RMarkdown file [`Activity.Rmd`](https://github.com/zanenmw/Practical-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Activity.Rmd).
